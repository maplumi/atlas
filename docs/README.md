# Atlas Documentation

Atlas is a WebGPU-first, Rust/WASM spatiotemporal compute and rendering engine.

It is designed to:
- Standardize spatial + temporal datasets into native, analysis-ready formats
- Stream and render massive scenes in 2D and 3D
- Run native analysis in-browser (e.g., overlay, distance, line-of-sight)
- Enable programmable cartography (styles + behavior as programs)
- Provide deterministic replay and reproducible “scene packages”
- Support real-time data feeds and AI-native query planning (planned)
